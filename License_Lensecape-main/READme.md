# Final Year Project - License Lensecape

This repository contains the codebase for a License Plate Recognition System, implemented with Flask (backend) and React (frontend).

## Backend

### Files

1. **`Final_FYP/backend/cropped_images_cam1`**: This directory is used to store cropped images of license plates captured by the system.

2. **`Final_FYP/backend/__pycache__`**: This directory contains Python bytecode files generated by the Python interpreter. It's safe to ignore for version control.

3. **`Final_FYP/backend/venv`**: This directory typically contains the virtual environment for the project. It's recommended not to include virtual environments in version control. Add it to `.gitignore`.

4. **`Final_FYP/backend/app.py`**: The main Flask application file that initializes the backend server.

5. **`Final_FYP/backend/App.js`**: This file may contain React components or logic relevant to the backend.

6. **`Final_FYP/backend/best .pt`**: The YOLOv8 model file used for object detection.

7. **`Final_FYP/backend/capture.py`**: File responsible for capturing frames from the webcam.

8. **`Final_FYP/backend/main.py`**: Main entry point for the backend.

9. **`Final_FYP/backend/object_detection.py`**: Module for initializing and performing object detection using YOLOv8.

10. **`Final_FYP/backend/ocr.py`**: Module for initializing and performing Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

11. **`Final_FYP/backend/requirements.txt`**: A file containing the Python dependencies required for the project.

### Running the Backend

To run the backend, execute the following steps:

1. Set up a virtual environment and install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Frontend

### Files

1. **`Final_FYP/frontend/node_modules`**: This directory contains dependencies and libraries for the frontend. It's recommended not to include it in version control.

2. **`Final_FYP/frontend/public`**: This directory contains static assets that will be served as-is.

3. **`Final_FYP/frontend/src`**: This directory typically contains the source code for the React components and application logic.

4. **`Final_FYP/frontend/index.html`**: The main HTML file for the React application.

5. **`Final_FYP/frontend/package.json`**: Configuration file that holds various metadata about the project, including the list of dependencies.

6. **`Final_FYP/frontend/package-lock.json`**: Automatically generated file used to lock the versions of the dependencies.

7. **`Final_FYP/frontend/README.md`**: Documentation for the React frontend.

8. **`Final_FYP/frontend/vite.config.js`**: Configuration file for Vite, the frontend build tool.

### Running the Frontend

To run the frontend, execute the following steps:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd Final_FYP/frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
